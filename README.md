# First-set-bit
The first set bit found from right side in the binary representation of the number

Task:
The task is to complete the function getFirstSetBit() that takes n as parameter and returns the the position of first set bit.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
0 <= N <= 106

Example:
Input:
3
18
12
0

Output:
2
3
0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Binary representation of 18 is 010010, the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.
Testcase 2: Binary representation of  12 is 1100, the first set bit from the right side is at position 3.
Testcase 3: In 0 there is no set bit so we print 0 as mentioned.
